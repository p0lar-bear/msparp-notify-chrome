# MSPARP Notifier #

An RP group and I use an MSPARP room as a general chatroom, and I was getting sick of missing people coming and going because I was focused on something else. So I threw together a Chrome extension that plays a sound whenever a message is posted while the window doesn't have focus.

That's really all there is to say on the matter.
