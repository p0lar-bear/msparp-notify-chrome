*** TODO Sound Chooser [0/3]
    Dynamically-generated list of files stored in the extension.
**** TODO Research JavaScript File API
     It may be more or less deprecated by the W3 but Chrome still uses it
     in its API. I want to know if it's possible for an extension to
     write a blob to disk.
**** TODO Implement custom sounds
     If the File API can write to the extension directory, possibility for
     unlimited custom sounds. Otherwise, chrome.storage.local should have
     room enough for some small sound data. Nobody needs to play a whole
     song for a notification.
**** TODO More sounds
     Gonna need some help finding them.
*** DONE Volume Control
** TODO Popup notifications
   Using chrome.notifications
*** TODO Logic
*** TODO Options page
